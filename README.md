# LEDStripVisualiser
Software to visualise music with an arduino and a msgeq7 on an LED strip
Also runs on ESP8266 so that LED strip can be controlled over the internet.

Currently in testing
Currently three music visulisation programs work which can be cycled through through a GET request to the ESP8266's IP
Also whole strip can be used as a white light with variable brightness through the same method.
